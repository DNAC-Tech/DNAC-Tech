- 👋 Hi, I’m @DNAC-Tech
- 👀 I’m interested in moving from just reading scripts and code to learning HOW to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me progress and learn.  I learn best by doing, and by driving people insane with questions.
- 😄 Pronouns: you can call me "Anything but late for dinner."
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a very quirky sense of humor and can turn just about any snarky response into a "thats what she said" joke or relate it to a song/song lyrics.
